Gamification has been defined as the use of \emph{game-design elements} for \emph{non-game context} to motivate and improve user activity and retention \cite{deterding2011game, hamari2014does}. Following the success of the location-based services \emph{Foursquare}, the idea of gamification has become a trending topic in interaction design and digital marketing \cite{deterding2011game} in recent years. By using game elements as motivational affordances, gamified applications have showed their effectiveness in producing desired \emph{psychological} (e.g., user experience, engagement, fun, etc.) and \emph{behavioral outcomes} (e.g, participation, performance, productivity, etc.) \cite{deterding2011game}. Currently, there is no specified collection of game elements which could be used in gamified systems; it depends on the intentional purpose and the non-game context. Some commonly used elements are: points, level and progression, awards, goal/challenge, badges and leader-board.

With the success stories of gamification in motivating users, we hypothesize that this concept is also beneficial to improving aforementioned situation in current reservation systems.
