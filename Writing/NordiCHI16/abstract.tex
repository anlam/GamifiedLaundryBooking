This paper describes the approach of gamifying traditional reservation systems for shared facilities in order to improve user experience and usage effectiveness. In particular, we apply the solution to enhance dormitory laundry room usage and present {\toolname} which is a gamified laundry booking system. Similar to any reservation systems,  {\toolname} allows users to reserve washing machines and manage their bookings on mobile phone. Moreover, the system also sends reminders of upcoming booking and finished jobs as well as provides a real time status observation and usage statistics of the machines. Finally, by using game elements: levels, points and leader-board, the systems brings users into playful experiments and changes their behaviors toward efficiently using of the machines.
