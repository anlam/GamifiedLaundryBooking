We have presented {\toolname} - a laundry booking system which uses gamification as a service layer of reward and penalty system with points, levels and leader board. Apart from typical functions of a reservation system such as making and managing bookings and setting reminders, {\toolname} also provides users with informative features such as real-time state observation and usage statistics of the machine. Furthermore, by using game elements as motivational affordance, the system helps improve user experience and engagement. Findings from interviews reveal that the system potentially engage users into using the application and doing laundry with fun and exciting experience. Additionally, the interviewees also supposed that with this application, they would change their laundry habits in long run.

Using incentive for motivating users is not a new idea. However, as far as we know, there is no work actually applies game elements such as levels or leader board into booking systems. We believe our presented idea could be extended to any reservation systems especially for shared facilities in order to engage users into using facilities as well as gain a uniform distribution of the requests.
