The idea of a system that affords reservation, observation and notification is not new. It has been widely used in transportation, hotel or even entertainment industries for years. Nowadays, every online reservation systems allow users to reserve services in advance, manage bookings and remind them whenever the time coming. 

There are also some works putting effort on flow optimization such as introducing the concept of ``Reward Pool'' which provides its users with incentives to improve its utilization \cite{winand2006methods}. For example, today most travel reservation systems  award money to the users as an incentive for reserving unpopular time-slots. In \cite{gauld2000solving}, the authors proposed using priority criteria and access threshold in order to remove waiting list of surgical and medical procedures. Edara \emph{et al.} presented Highway Space Inventory Control System which is a booking system for highway trip that determine whether to accept or reject a reservation based on a pre-defined demand in order to optimize the highway allocations for different traffic scenarios \cite{edara2008model}. 

All these solutions are only adaptable for a particular situation and could not be reused at all. In this project, we extend the idea of reservation system toward gamification in order to not only improve user experience but also address the optimization problem.
